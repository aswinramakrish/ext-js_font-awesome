ext-js_font-awesome
===================

Font Awesome and Bootstrap icons are really awesome! This is a hack to use those classes in iconCls in Ext JS.

Currently, I just have the sequence for TreeNode. I will be including more Ext JS components in the future.

For this to work, make sure you have Ext JS (3+) and Font Awesome setup and working.
